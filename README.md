# UART-Interfacing-with-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to interface a PIC microcontroller with UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) for serial communication. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. UART is widely used for communication between microcontrollers, sensors, and external devices like PCs.
