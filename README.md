# UART-Interfacing-with-PIC-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to interface a PIC microcontroller with UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter) for serial communication. The code is written in Embedded C using MPLAB IDE, and the simulation is done in Proteus. UART is widely used for communication between microcontrollers, sensors, and external devices like PCs.
# Features
Sends and receives data over UART.
Displays received data on a terminal (virtual or hardware).
Uses polling or interrupt-based UART communication.
# Tools Used
Microcontroller: PIC,
Programming Language: Embedded C,
IDE: MPLAB IDE,
Simulation Software: Proteus
# How It Works
The PIC microcontrollerâ€™s UART module is configured with a baud rate.
Data is transmitted and received over UART.
Received data is displayed on a terminal (e.g., Proteus Virtual Terminal).
